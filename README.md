- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know? In 2013, a group of scientists discovered a species of fungus called Ophiocordyceps unilateralis that infects ants and takes over their brains, turning them into "zombie ants" 🧟‍♂️. The fungus forces the ants to climb vegetation and clamp onto leaves, where they eventually die, allowing the fungus to grow and spread its spores. It's like a real-life horror movie, but with ants! 🐜😱
